    abstract = { Rolling element bearing faults of a laboratory scale wind turbine gearbox operating under nonstationary loads have been diagnosed using condition monitoring (CM) techniques such as vibration analysis, acoustic analysis, and lubrication oil analysis. Two local bearing faults, namely, bearing inner race fault and bearing outer fault are seeded in the gearbox. The raw data from these techniques are decomposed and wavelet approximation coefficients of level four (a4) are extracted using discrete wavelet transform (DWT). A plethora of statistical features is computed from the wavelet approximation coefficients and the most significant features are being identified by implementing the decision tree algorithm. The classification efficiencies of each of these CM techniques are compared by using the support-vector machine algorithm. Furthermore, an integrated CM scheme is developed by combining the individual CM techniques and the fault diagnosing ability of the integrated CM scheme is compared with the individual CM techniques. A principal component analysis-based approach is used as a feature classification algorithm and an input feature matrix is formed by combining the significant features extracted from vibration, acoustic, and lubrication oil analysis. It has been observed that the integrated CM scheme has provided better classification interpretations than the single CM techniques and it can be extended for real time fault diagnosis of a wind turbine gearbox. }
